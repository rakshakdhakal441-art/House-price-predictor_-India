# 🏠 House Price Prediction App

This project is a Machine Learning application that predicts house prices based on various features. The application is built using **Python** and **Streamlit** for the web interface, and it uses a **Random Forest Regressor** model trained on housing data.

## 📊 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to provide an estimated house price based on user inputs. The model was trained using a dataset of house prices in India, filtering for the most relevant features to ensure accurate predictions.

### Key Features Used for Prediction:
* **Number of Bedrooms:** Count of bedrooms in the house.
* **Number of Bathrooms:** Count of bathrooms (including half-baths).
* **Living Area:** The size of the living area in square feet.
* **Condition:** A rating of the house's condition (on a scale of 1-5).
* **Number of Schools Nearby:** The count of schools in the immediate vicinity.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
* **Python:** The core programming language.
* **Streamlit:** For creating the interactive web interface.
* **Scikit-Learn:** For building and training the Machine Learning model (Random Forest).
* **Pandas & NumPy:** For data manipulation and processing.
* **Joblib:** For saving and loading the trained model.
